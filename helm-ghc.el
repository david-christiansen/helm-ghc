;;; Commentary:
;; This is a Helm datasource for GHC-mod errors. When ghc-mod places
;; at least one error overlay in the buffer, running `helm-ghc-errors'
;; will open a buffer that lists the errors.
;;
;; To use it, simply bind the command to a key in `haskell-mode-map'
;; (because ghc-mod isn't yet a proper minor mode). For example:
;; (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook
;;           (lambda () (define-key haskell-mode-map (kbd "C-c ?") 'helm-ghc-errors)))


;;; Code:

;; We don't need to actually depend on ghc-mod, because the only thing
;; we use are properties of its overlays. If it's not present,
;; `helm-ghc-errors' will simply return an empty buffer.
